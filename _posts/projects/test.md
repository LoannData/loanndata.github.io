## [Rectangular Hilbert Grid Generator](https://github.com/LoannData/RectHilbert_Generator) 

A tool I developed by grabbing pieces of code on the web and reading papers about Hilbert algorithms. The objective of this tool is to be able to 
create a *grid to line* transformation of a randomly sized $$2^L \times 2^h$$ 2D grid which can be used to attribute cells in a contiguous way to $$2^N$$ calculation 
processes in the case of a 2D grid cell numerical simulation for example.
