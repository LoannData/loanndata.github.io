## Quantitative Finance 

*2021* - **Systematic Trading Software - Hedge-Fund** 

*2020* - [**Algorithmic Trading Environment**](/_alphatrading/)

The Alpha-Trading tool is an open-source python library designed to develop, test and run algorithmic trading strategies inside a normalized, free and fully customizable environment.

## PhD in Astrophysics 

*2017-2020* - [**Python/C++ Cosmic Rays Propagation code**](/_portfolio/crspectra/)

CR SPECTRA is a theoretical/numerical transport code developed in Python and C++ that allows to model how Cosmic Rays are released by Supernovae Remnants and how they do propagate in a magnetized turbulent Interstellar Medium with which they interact. 

*2019-2020* - [**Sub-grid CRs diffusion coefficients in the RAMSES code**](/_portfolio/ramses/)

RAMSES code is an 3-Dimensional AMR Astrophysical simulation developped since 2008 by more than 200 researchers in various fields from Cosmology to Astrochemistry. In this code, I implemented an equation allowing to describe the transport of a non-thermal Cosmic Rays distribution within a cold magnetized and turbulent Interstellar Medium.

*2017* - [**Small Scale Turbulence code**](/_portfolio/sst/)

Small Scale Turbulence is a theoretical model of Cosmic Rays self-regulated and generated Magnetic Turbulence.  

## Projects for fun 

*2017* - [**3D N-Body numerical simulation**](/_portfolio/nbody/)

Development of a 3-Dimensional gravitational N-body simulation in C++ for the fun! The code has the following features: Brute force calculation (CPU based), 
Object Oriented structure, Second order time symmetric Verlet solver 

*2018* - [**Rectangular Hilbert Grid Generator**](/_portfolio/hilbergrid/)

A tool I developed by grabbing pieces of code on the web and reading papers about Hilbert algorithms. The objective of this tool is to be able to 
create a *grid to line* transformation of a randomly sized $$2^L \times 2^h$$ 2D grid which can be used to attribute cells in a contiguous way to $$2^N$$ calculation 
processes in the case of a 2D grid cell numerical simulation for example. 

## Blogging 

*2015* - [**Popularization website in Physics**](/_portfolio/physiquereussite/)

Popularization website about Physics. The aim of this project is to help people to have a better understanding of what is Physics: models, methods and 
processes. The website is well referenced by Google and get more than 2000 unique users per month and content is recommended by University professors for their 
students.
