## [Python/C++ 2D CR SPECTRA code](https://github.com/LoannData/CR_SPECTRA) 

The Cosmic Rays Self Propagation Escaping an Confinement TRAnsport code (CR SPECTRA) describe the non-linear relation between the way high energy 
particles are released in the Interstellar Medium from Supernova Remnant and the magnetic turbulence they generate in a close environment around the 
source, turbulence which contributes to confine particles close to the accelerator and then to affect the escape process itself.

The code consists in solving the following non-linearly coupled system of four equations 

$$ \begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial P_\mathrm{p}}{\partial t} + V_\mathrm{A} \frac{\partial P_\mathrm{p}}{\partial z} & = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \kappa_{zz} \frac{\partial P_\mathrm{p}}{\partial z} \right) +
\frac{E}{3} \left\{ V_\mathrm{A}, P_\mathrm{p} \right\} - 
\frac{4}{3} \frac{\partial V_\mathrm{A}}{\partial z} P_\mathrm{p} + Q_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{inj}} \\ 
\frac{\partial P_\mathrm{e}}{\partial t} + V_\mathrm{A} \frac{\partial P_\mathrm{e}}{\partial z} & = 
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \kappa_{zz} \frac{\partial P_\mathrm{e}}{\partial z} \right) +
\frac{E}{3} \left\{ V_\mathrm{A}, P_\mathrm{e} \right\} - 
\frac{4}{3} \frac{\partial V_\mathrm{A}}{\partial z} P_\mathrm{e} + Q_{\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{inj}} + Q_{\mathrm{e}, \mathrm{sync}}(P_\mathrm{e}) \\ 
\frac{\partial I_+}{\partial t} + V_\mathrm{A} \frac{\partial I_+}{\partial z} & = 
- I_+ \frac{\partial V_\mathrm{A}}{\partial z} + \Gamma_\mathrm{g}^+ I_+ - 
\Gamma_\mathrm{d}^+ (I_+ - I_+^0) \\ 
\frac{\partial I_-}{\partial t} + V_\mathrm{A} \frac{\partial I_-}{\partial z} & = 
- I_- \frac{\partial V_\mathrm{A}}{\partial z} + \Gamma_\mathrm{g}^- I_- - 
\Gamma_\mathrm{d}^+ (I_- - I_-^0) 
\end{aligned} $$ 

in a two dimensional phase space where the first dimension represents the spatial direction in which galactic scale magnetic field lines are 
correlated (see the figure above) and the second dimension represents the energy associated to the resonant Alfv√©n waves interacting with the released CRs. 

The system is solved using first and second order finite difference methods for explicit solvers and implicit methods for the diffusion term. This system has 
some particularities: 

- The diffusion coefficient $$\kappa_{zz}$$ depends on the turbulence rates $$I_\pm$$ 
- An energy log scale has been used to solve energy related terms 
- The Interstellar Medium model is inhomogeneous leading to a space variable initial diffusion coefficient $$\kappa_{zz}(z, t = 0)$$
- Cosmic Rays (protons p and electrons e) are injected through a term $$Q_{\mathrm{p,e,inj}}$$ itself depending on the turbulence rates $$I_\pm$$ 
- Cosmic Rays generate turbulence $$I_\pm$$ through linear thermal instability terms $$\Gamma_g^\pm$$ 
- CRs generated turbulence $$I_\pm$$ is progressively damped ($$\Gamma_\mathrm{d}^\pm$$) down to the background turbulence state $$I_\pm^0$$ according the Interstellar Medium plasma physical properties

## [Small Scale Turbulence code](https://github.com/LoannData/SST)

Development of a Python analytical code allowing to modelise the magnetic turbulence generated by Cosmic Ray instabilities and damped by interaction with 
a partially ionized plasma. The following equation is solved: 

$$ \Gamma_\mathrm{g} + \Gamma_\mathrm{in} = 0$$ 

where $$\Gamma_\mathrm{g}$$ corresponds to the magnetic turbulence growth rate and depends mainly on the Cosmic Rays distribution, energy and pressure 
gradient, and $$\Gamma_\mathrm{in}$$ corresponds to the magnetic turbulence damping rate which mainly depends on the physical properties of the plasma we 
consider the waves are propagating in: density, temperature, ionization rate, turbulence rate. Each of both terms is subject to a deep bibliographical theoretical 
and experimental study. The models of wave growth and damping are then implemented in the code and allow to solve the above equation. 

Because Cosmic Rays are charged particles (here we consider protons), they are sensible to magnetic turbulence and their propagation properties are also 
affected by magnetic turbulence. Depending on the interstellar medium phase I have chosen, I have been able to calculate the mean free path of Cosmic 
Rays as a function of their kinetic energy for my small scale turbulence model (continuous colored lines) and compare it with the standard model which doesn't 
take in account medium properties (black dashed line).

## [3D N-Body numerical simulation](https://github.com/LoannData/3D-N-Body)

Development of a 3-Dimensional gravitational N-body simulation in C++ for the fun! The code has the following features: 

- Brute force calculation (CPU based)
- Object Oriented structure 
- Second order time symmetric Verlet solver

selected from a batch of 1000 particles. Colors represent the norm of the velocity of each particle.
