Welcome ! I am a Research Scientist with an experience on Computational Physics, Artificial Intelligence and Data Driven systems applied to financial markets. I earned my Ph.D in Astrophysics from the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/) and I am currently working as a Quantitative Developer and Strategist applied to financial markets. 

## Doctor of Philosophy

As a [Ph.D researcher](http://www.theses.fr/2020MONTS048) I have worked on the Cosmic Ray transport in the Interstellar Medium. My work has been [published][1] in [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.aanda.org/) and in the [Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society](https://academic.oup.com/mnras) journals. My research has explored the way Cosmic Rays are released by Supernova Remnants in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and how they do interact with ISM turbulent plasma and how they may impact the global Star Formation Rate (SFR) of our galaxy. For this purpose I have developed a semi-analytic and kinetic [code](https://github.com/LoannData/CR_SPECTRA) in Python and C++ which modelize how the CRs escape process from SNRs may be itself affected by the magnetic turbulence it generate via CR-ISM plasma wave interactions. In order to understand how CRs generated turbulence affects the galactic SFR, I implemented my model of CRs turbulence generation in the AMR-MHD [RAMSES](https://irfu.cea.fr/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast_sstechnique.php?id_ast=904) [code](https://github.com/LoannData/RAMSES_ANISO_CR) and simulated how a biphasic turbulent thermally unstable ISM is affected by the CRs streaming instabilities. It has been shown that a such process tends to reduce the galactic SFR by slowing down the molecular cloud gravitational collapse. 

## Quantitative Researcher

As a Quantitative Developer/Reasercher applied to financial market, I am working on the development of an open source algorithmic trading environment in Python dedicated to help any trader to only focus on the development of his/her trading strategy. This project concatenates the following modules: 

- A backtester whose objective is to help the trader to develop and test the robustness for his/her strategy based on historical data or algorithmically generated data. A lot of functionnality have been implemented and are going to be implemented but the main characteristic of this tool this that a particular attention is put on the realism of the simulations. Another interesting feature is that the backtester is able to consider multi-asset trading strategies. 
- A trading module whose the objective is to make run strategies developed and tested with the backtester module. Key features have been implemented and will be implemented in this module. A multi-broker connection is available so that no needs to code your own trading API. I'm currently working on a crypted messaging system allowing to perform copy trading and trading signals exchange for any user of the tool.  

Although this system is at its beta stage, it is already functional and I use it to develop my own trading strategies. In this frame I have developed patterns, 
trends, levels detection indicators and with collaborators have developed a prototype of a trading strategy. 

## Data Scientist 

As a Data Scientist, I have a great interest in algorithms and methods allowing to enlight symmetries in noisy datasets and modelize complex structures with the 
best ratio accuracy over model kernel entropy. I can use a large panel of technologies from Deep Neural Networks to Genetic Optimizers or Graph Algorithms and I love to explore new methods and their best applications. I'm also learning about serving and automatic data pipeline technologies and I have an expertise in 
data representation and dashboard creation with Dash.  

I have an entrepreneur instinct and I always integrate business success metrics in my developments. I try to find the best product development path to 
optimize the ROI. I love working in a team, tackling huge challenges and exchanging on variety of technical subjects, I never win alone.
