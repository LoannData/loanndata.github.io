Head
Footer
The bread and butter of any theme. Below you’ll find the layouts included with Minimal Mistakes, what they look like and the type of content they’ve been built for.

Default layoutPermalink
The base layout all other layouts inherit from. There’s not much to this layout apart from pulling in several _includes:

<head> elements
masthead navigation links
{{ content }}
page footer
scripts
Note: You won’t ever assign this layout directly to a post or page. Instead all other layouts will build off of it by setting layout: default in their YAML Front Matter.

Layout based and user-defined classesPermalink
Class names corresponding to each layout are automatically added to the <body> element eg. <body class="layout--single">.

layout	class name
archive	.layout--archive
archive-taxonomy	.layout--archive-taxonomy
search	.layout--search
single	.layout--single
splash	.layout--splash
home	.layout--home
posts	.layout--posts
categories	.layout--categories
category	.layout--category
tags	.layout--tags
tag	.layout--tag
Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript. Perfect for “art directed” posts or adding custom styles to specific pages.

Example:

---
layout: splash
classes:
  - landing
  - dark-theme
