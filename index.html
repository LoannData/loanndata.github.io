<h2>Who am I ? </h2>

I have a Doctorate in Astrophysics from the University of Montpellier (France) and an entrepreneurial experience on financial markets. I consider myself 
as a Data Scientist and as a Quantitative Research/Developer. I have a lot of research/development interests, here is a non-exhaustive list: 

<ul>
    <li>Numerical simulations</li>
    <li>Data modelling and analysis </li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
    <li>Stochastics processes</li>
